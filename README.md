# MTS Anomaly Detection Experience Report
An Empirical Analysis of Anomaly Detection Methods for Multivariate Time Series.

We tested the performance of 8 unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms on 6 public datasets and 2 private datasets, and conducted a large number of experiments. In this repository, we have open-sourced the 8 algorithms we used and our own developed visualization tools for data analysis.
